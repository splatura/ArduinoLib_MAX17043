MAX17043/44 library for Arduino

My attempt to port this to Mongoose OS for the ESP32

The MAX17043/MAX17044 are ultra-compact, low-cost, host-side fuel-gauge systems 
for lithium-ion (Li+) batteries in handheld and portable equipment. 

The MAX17043 is configured to operate with a single lithium cell 
and the MAX17044 is configured for a dual-cell 2S pack.
